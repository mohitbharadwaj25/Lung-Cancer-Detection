# Lung-Cancer-Detection
In this project we choose lung cancer dataset which has 307 samples and 16 attributes.
We performed Iterative model selection to find out the best model for the performance metrics. 
We focuses on the Recall value more because we donâ€™t want to miss any positive LUNG_CANCER cases.
